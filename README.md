# Project assumptions
I've started to create this project in response to my family's needs. I'm one of 6 siblings, and the tendency to have many children is popular in my family. 
A few years ago, we decided that everyone draws one person and gives one gift because buying gifts for every single member of my family was a really expensive undertaking. 
Each one of us prepared a letter to Santa, and each one of us drew one person to give a gift to. 
Then, I had the idea that it would be perfect to have our own space to provide all the features needed for this event.
