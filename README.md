## Project assumptions
I started this project in response to my family's needs. I'm one of 6 siblings, and the tradition of having many children is popular in my family.
A few years ago, we decided that everyone would draw one person and give one gift because buying gifts for every single member of my family was a really expensive undertaking.
Each one of us prepared a letter to Santa, and each one of us drew one person to give a gift to.
Then, I had the idea that it would be perfect to have our own space to provide all the features needed for this event.
